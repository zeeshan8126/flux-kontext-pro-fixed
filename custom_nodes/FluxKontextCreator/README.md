## 🧠 Fusion Mastery Guide

### 🎯 **FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE**
**Your prompt determines HOW the AI interprets and fuses your images.** The combination_mode creates the reference layout, but your **prompt language** controls the fusion strategy.

### 🔥 **COMBINATION MODE STRATEGIES**

#### **side_by_side (BEST FOR CHARACTER FUSION)**
**When to use:** Merging people, faces, or distinct subjects
**Prompt approach:** Direct fusion language
```
✅ "merge the two people into one person"
✅ "combine their best features into a single character"
✅ "the woman and child as one unified person"
```

#### **overlay (BEST FOR STYLE/ATMOSPHERE)**
**When to use:** Style transfer, mood blending, artistic effects
**Prompt approach:** Atmospheric and stylistic language
```
✅ "apply the vintage mood to the modern portrait"
✅ "blend the lighting and atmosphere from both images"
✅ "combine the artistic style with the main subject"
```

#### **grid_2x2 (BEST FOR MULTI-ELEMENT SCENES)**
**When to use:** Complex scenes with multiple objects/elements
**Prompt approach:** Spatial and compositional language
```
✅ "arrange all elements in a cohesive interior scene"
✅ "create a unified composition from all four elements"
✅ "blend the room elements with the people naturally"
```

#### **all_in_one (BATCH PROCESSING)**
**When to use:** Processing multiple variations simultaneously
**Prompt approach:** Consistent transformation language
```
✅ "apply the same artistic style to all subjects"
✅ "transform each person with the same lighting effect"
✅ "create consistent character variations"
```

### 📝 **PROMPT FRAMEWORKS**

#### **LEVEL 1: BASIC FUSION PROMPTS**
```
Subject Fusion: "[Person A] combined with [Person B] as [desired outcome]"
Object Integration: "merge [object] with [object] into [result]"
Style Transfer: "[subject] in the style of [reference style]"
```

**Examples:**
- ✅ "the blonde woman holding the small dog in a restaurant"
- ✅ "combine the child's innocence with the woman's elegance"
- ✅ "merge the two hairstyles into one unique look"

#### **LEVEL 2: ADVANCED FUSION PROMPTS**
```
Characteristic Fusion: "blend [specific features] from both subjects"
Environmental Integration: "[subject] naturally placed in [environment] with [lighting/mood]"
Temporal Fusion: "[age/time reference] version of [combined subjects]"
```

**Examples:**
- ✅ "blend the woman's facial features with the child's eye color and smile"
- ✅ "the combined person sitting naturally in the restaurant with warm lighting"
- ✅ "teenage version combining both their facial structures"

#### **LEVEL 3: EXPERT FUSION PROMPTS**
```
Multi-Attribute Control: "[feature 1] + [feature 2] + [environment] + [mood] + [style]"
Narrative Fusion: "[story context] showing [relationship] between [fused elements]"
Technical Specifications: "[specific technical requirements] for [fusion result]"
```

**Examples:**
- ✅ "blonde curly hair + bright eyes + cozy restaurant + happy expression + professional portrait style"
- ✅ "mother-daughter bond visualized as one person showing both generations"
- ✅ "photorealistic fusion maintaining facial symmetry and natural lighting"

### 🚫 **COMMON MISTAKES & FIXES**

#### **❌ MISTAKE: Scene Description Instead of Fusion**
```
Wrong: "two people sitting in a restaurant"
✅ Right: "the combined person sitting in the restaurant"
```

#### **❌ MISTAKE: Vague Fusion Instructions**
```
Wrong: "mix them together"
✅ Right: "blend the woman's features with the child's smile and eye color"
```

#### **❌ MISTAKE: Conflicting Requirements**
```
Wrong: "keep both people separate but combine them"
✅ Right: "merge both people into one unified character"
```

#### **❌ MISTAKE: Over-Complex Prompts**
```
Wrong: "create a fusion of the woman and child while maintaining their individual characteristics but also blending them into one person with specific features..."
✅ Right: "blend the woman and child into one person with combined features"
```

## 📖 Example Workflows

### Standard Text Editing

```
Input: Photo of person wearing blue shirt
Prompt: "Change the shirt color to red"
Result: Same person now wearing red shirt
```

### Character Fusion (Experimental)

```
Input 1: Photo of blonde woman
Input 2: Photo of child with dog
Mode: side_by_side + force_fusion=True
Prompt: "the blonde woman holding the dog in a restaurant"
Result: Single person (fusion of both) holding dog in restaurant setting
```

### Style Transfer (Experimental)

```
Input 1: Modern portrait
Input 2: Vintage photo
Mode: overlay + force_fusion=False
Prompt: "apply the vintage aesthetic to the modern portrait"
Result: Modern person with vintage styling and atmosphere
```

### Multi-Element Scene (Experimental)

```
Input: 4 different room elements
Mode: grid_2x2 + force_fusion=True
Prompt: "create a cohesive living room with all these elements"
Result: Unified interior design combining all elements
```

### Standard Example Prompts

```
✅ Good prompts:
"Change the car color to red"
"Add sunglasses to the person"
"Make the background a beach scene"
"Replace 'Hello' with 'Welcome'"
"Turn the cat into a dog"

❌ Avoid:
Empty instructions
Very long complex descriptions
Conflicting instructions
```

### Safety Tolerance Guide

- **0-2**: Very strict content filtering
- **3-4**: Balanced filtering (recommended)
- **5-6**: More permissive for creative work

## 🔬 Advanced Techniques

### **🔄 force_fusion Parameter**

#### **force_fusion = True (RECOMMENDED FOR FUSION)**
- **Use for:** All character/object fusion tasks
- **Effect:** Activates advanced fusion prompting system
- **Prompt style:** Direct fusion language
- **Result:** True blending and merging of elements

#### **force_fusion = False**
- **Use for:** Scene enhancement, style application
- **Effect:** Standard Kontext processing
- **Prompt style:** Traditional editing language
- **Result:** Scene modification and enhancement

### **📏 Optimal Image Counts**
- **2 images:** Perfect for character fusion
- **3-4 images:** Good for complex scenes
- **5+ images:** Use with grid or all_in_one modes

### Iterative Editing

Chain multiple Flux Kontext Creator nodes to build complex edits:

```
Image → Kontext1 ("Add hat") → Kontext2 ("Change background") → Final Result
```

### Text Editing

For text within images, use quotation marks:
```
Replace 'Old Text' with 'New Text'
```

### Character Consistency

The model excels at maintaining character identity across edits:
```
"Put the same person in a different outfit"
"Move the character to a beach setting"
```

## 🛠 **PARAMETER OPTIMIZATION GUIDE**

### **🎨 Model Selection**
- **flux-kontext-pro:** Balanced speed and quality, ideal for most fusion tasks
- **flux-kontext-max:** Maximum quality and prompt adherence for critical fusions

### **📐 Combination Mode Selection**
```
Character Fusion: side_by_side + force_fusion=True + direct prompts
Style Transfer: overlay + force_fusion=False + atmospheric prompts
Complex Scenes: grid_2x2 + force_fusion=True + spatial prompts
Batch Processing: all_in_one + force_fusion=False + consistent prompts
```

### **🎯 Resize Mode Selection**
- **fit_largest:** Best for maintaining detail in high-res images
- **fit_smallest:** Good for consistent sizing across all images
- **no_resize:** Use when all images are already properly sized

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Node not appearing in ComfyUI:**
- Restart ComfyUI completely
- Check console for error messages
